# Predictive Analytics For Vehicle Fuel Consumption

This project investigates how various vehicle attributes influence city-cycle fuel consumption using machine learning techniques. The aim is to segment the data using unsupervised learning, predict fuel consumption (`mpg`) using supervised learning models, and evaluate the results with multiple regression models.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: 
    - Use **unsupervised learning** techniques to cluster vehicles.
    - Apply **supervised learning** techniques to predict the fuel efficiency (miles per gallon - `mpg`) of vehicles.
    - Perform **regression analysis** to compare different models and report on significant predictors.

## Features

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
    - Handle missing values , concatinate dataset and feature engineering (such as power-to-weight ratio).
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    - Visualize relationships between variables and understand the correlation between vehicle features and fuel consumption.
3. **Clustering**: 
    - Cluster vehicles using K-Means and analyze how clusters behave differently.
4. **Regression Models**:
    - Linear Regression
5. **Model Evaluation**:
    - Evaluate each model using Mean Squared Error (MSE)
    - Visualize true vs predicted `mpg` values.
